# ProjectZeal
A trio of C programs demonstrating fundamental logic and proficiency.

This repository includes three C programs created for Task 2 of CodeZilla Technical Recruitment (Fundamental Programming). Each program addresses a specific subtask and demonstrates basic problem-solving using C.

F1: Sum of Digits – Calculates the sum of the digits in an integer.

F2: Leap Year Checker – Determines whether a given year is a leap year.

F3: Reverse a Word – Reverses a word using loops (no built-in functions).

These programs focus on core C programming concepts and are suitable for use in an online compiler.
